Static::First Pass
  Composition
    -Boring; it could be pushed further
    -All the skulls are similarly sized; none of them really draw attention
    -Too many Skulls too close together
    -Wall of static needs depth
    -Wall of static should be pool of static in some places
    -No gaps between skulls that shows other static
    -Narrower composition?
    +tiered skulls are great
    -skulls could be more tiered
  Models
    Skulls
      +Hard to tell that all the skulls are the same
      -Differentiate some with cracks and deformities
      -smooth out edges on some
    Tears
      -needs to be created
    EyeBlocks
      -need to be created
  Shaders
    -Static could use other passes
      -Depth pass
      -Motion pass
      -jitter pass
    -Static initial pass could have more space between the static kernals
    -Skulls need shading
      -Crawling Edge detection shading
      -Jitter shading?
      -Melt shading?


Static::Next Steps
  models
    -create tears
    -create blocks
  composition
    -differentiate skull models to give more visual variance
    -remove skull models
    -implement new fixed resolution
  shaders
    static
      -space out initial pass
      -add random displacement pass
      -add depth pass
      -add normals pass
      -add motion pass
    skulls
      -blurred edge detection
